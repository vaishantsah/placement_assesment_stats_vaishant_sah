    "A measure of how closely two variables are related to one another is the coefficient of correlation. It spans from -1 to 1, with 0 denoting the least corelation, 1 denoting the strongest positive corelation, and -1 denoting the strongest negative corelation. It is determined by dividing the covariance of the two values by the product of their standard deviations.\n",

    "The correlation coefficient in this instance, which is 0.7, shows a substantial positive link between the SAT score and GPA. Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that a high GPA will be correlated with a high SAT score and vice versa."
